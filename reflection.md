In this program, I used a for loop. After doing this program, I learned how to a for loop and I applied this knowledge in my otehr programs, such as, the Canvas program. I did not change much in this program because this program was created near the end of the semester. Near the end of the semester, I learned how to create efficient and concise loops which I applied in my other programs. The only thing that I changed in this program was I added more articles, so then, there is not too much of a limited amount. I decided to make limited changes in this program because it is already short and concise. One of the six things that I used in this program, is loops. Loops are the main part of this program because without the loop, I would not be able to display the articles.

title: "Artificial intelligence that understands object relationships",
description: "In an effort to solve this problem, MIT researchers have developed a model that understands the underlying relationships between objects in a scene. Their model represents individual relationships one at a time, then combines these representations to describe the overall scene. This enables the model to generate more accurate images from text descriptions, even when the scene includes several objects that are arranged in different relationships with one another...",

  description: "Machine learning works by training the machine on vast quantities of data – pictures for image-recognition systems, or terabytes of prose taken from the internet for bots that generate semi-plausible essays, such as GPT2. But datasets are not simply neutral repositories of information; they often encode human biases in unforeseen ways. Recently, Facebook’s news feed algorithm asked users who saw a news video featuring black men if they wanted to “keep seeing videos about primates”. So-called “AI” is already being used in several US states to predict whether candidates for parole will reoffend, with critics claiming that the data the algorithms are trained on reflects historical bias in policing.",

title:"In AI development, equality starts with a mandate for fairness and inclusivity",
description: "Unfortunately, bias exists everywhere in the world and permeates the datasets used to develop and test AI products. Conscious bias can actually be a positive, useful tool in developing data for training AI applications, but it must be controlled. A developer makes trade-offs in the model: a little bit of improvement here means less performance there until a balance is struck that gives the optimal outcomes for the use case. Think of it as playing Whac-A-Mole — eliminate one poor area of performance in a model and another one can spring up unexpectedly somewhere else. The job of data scientists using AI to improve health outcomes is to whack as many “data moles” as possible. Developers need to focus the training sets for their models to ensure they’re using diverse data, or risk creating conscious bias.",

    description: "For their research, the team analyzed deep ocean sound recordings following 201 earthquakes that happened in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.Tsunamis often occur after vertical earthquakes, where tectonic plates on the earth's surface move mainly up and down rather than horizontally. This motion causes the displacement of a large amount of water, creating very long waves that can cause widespread damage onshore.The vertical motion results in compressing the water layer which sends specific sound signals that carry information on the dynamics and geometry of the fault. Mr Bernabe Gomez, a Ph.D. student in the research team, used this information to train artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to recognize when a vertical earthquake has occurred, which, they say, could be used to pinpoint future tsunamis in real-time.",

Last week, more than 400 German AI researchers published an open letter to the German government asking it to stop the development of these systems by its armed forces.“The killing of humans should never be automated based on algorithmic formulas,” the letter said. “Such dehumanisation of life and death decision-making by autonomous weapons systems must be outlawed worldwide.” Russell, who regularly meets governments internationally, said the US and Russia, together with the UK, Israel and Australia, were still against a ban.",

Computer vision, which allows computers to pull information from digital images, is a type of machine learning that has been around for decades.With that in mind, Vitriol and fellow corresponding author Peter Bubenik, PhD, a mathematician at the University of Florida and an expert on topological data analysis, decided to incorporate microscopy, topology, and AI to better understand how diseases impact the body.However, researchers needed to first gain insights into what is normal and what happens in disease states.

There are mainly two types of energy: renewable energy and non-renewable energy. Non-renewable energy includes fossil fuels like natural gas, petroleum and coal. However, these energy sources come from nature itself; it is impossible to renew them quickly. This means that these resources will become entirely exhausted in the upcoming years.In addition, fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases that are responsible for global warming. According to the report published by the Global Carbon Project, carbon dioxide emissions reached an all-time high in 2018. On the other hand, renewable energy includes energy sources that are available in infinite quantities, such as sunlight, air and water.",

Others assert that AI won’t live up to its hype—at least not in the near future—and will make only marginal improvements in the profession.

In the traditional sense, the answer could be ‘yes’ as new technologies make inroads in food service with solutions that can help streamline food preparation, dining and cleanup.Today’s dining halls have been drastically transformed by the pandemic, which has forced schools to rethink dining operations as they deal with significant staffing shortages, enforce social distancing measures in densely crowded spaces, and cope with supply chain constraints. These challenges are not only impacting students, who are experiencing long lines and extensive wait times, but also taking a toll on dining staff, who are dealing with the mounting pressure of serving large groups in a short period of time. In addition, college students’ eating habits have drastically changed over the last 20 years, with more students looking for healthier food choices and more snacks throughout the day.",

    title: "2021's Top Stories About AI",
    description: "2021 was the year in which the wonders of artificial intelligence stopped being a story. Which is not to say that IEEE Spectrum didn't cover AI—we covered the heck out of it. But we all know that deep learning can do wondrous things and that it's being rapidly incorporated into many industries; that's yesterday's news. Many of this year's top articles grappled with the limits of deep learning (today's dominant strand of AI) and spotlighted researchers seeking new paths.Here are the 10 most popular AI articles that Spectrum published in 2021, ranked by the amount of time people spent reading them.",

    title: "Artificial Intelligence: Defining an Often-Misused Term",
    description: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is perhaps one of the greatest buzzwords of all time. This high-tech term is bantered about endlessly in the media, and you can’t help but imagine cyborgs and self-driving cars when you hear it.

Despite its popularity, the term “artificial intelligence” is often misused. This piece explores what AI is and also explains how it differs from more traditional software programs.",

    title: "AI won’t replace psychologists, it will only make them better",
    description: "But if we learned anything from the Covid-19 pandemic, it is that interpersonal relationships are a fundamental human need. Therapists have reported a threefold increase in demand for psychological treatment since the onset of the pandemic. Psychologists, more than ever, are inundated by referrals and increased distress in their clients. Additionally, in mental health - unlike other areas of health - there is very minimal, if any, collection of objective and up-to-date data on the patient's condition and little to no ongoing monitoring of treatment progress. The question of whether the treatment helps the client reach their goals is also unanswered in systematic ways.",

    title: "What Are Some of the Long-Term Physical Effects of Using or Not Using a Prosthesis?",
    description: "Prosthetic users will eventually find physical effects related to the method of suspending the prosthesis on the residual limb. Despite today’s high-tech equipment, we still have some really low-tech problems. Increased skin temperatures of the residual limb, along with sweating, heat rash, blisters, contact dermatitis, abrasions and painful ingrown hairs may occur from the environment within the liners. Skin issues can progress to very dangerous conditions such as infection if not addressed. The warm, moist environment inside the liner is an ideal incubator for bacteria. This is true for both upper- and lower-limb amputees",

    title: "General Principles of Amputation Surgery",
    description: "The term ‘amputation’ is typically used to describe the removal of all or part of a limb, but technically it is more precise to reserve this term for the process of limb removal by dividing through one or more of the bones. The term ‘disarticulation’ is more precise for the process of removing a limb between joint surfaces. Each particular site throughout the upper or lower limbs has individualized characteristics of bone shape, nerves, musculature and blood vessels, as well as particular muscles, skin and soft tissue envelope structures available for padding, protecting, and reconstruction. An intimate understanding of the anatomy of all these sites and the various attributes and characteristics that impact healing and prosthetic rehabilitation are important when deciding where and how to amputate.",

    title: "Surgery and AI give amputees more precise control of a prosthetic hand, study shows",
    description: "In the new technique, a flap of muscle is wrapped around the severed nerves to allow the nerves to grow and fire electrical signals. The signals are then picked up by an implant placed in patients — the implant serves as a connection between the nervous system and a computer that patients are later hooked up to. Finally, a machine learning program interprets those nerve signals to allow patients to move a prosthetic hand seamlessly.The procedure described in the paper was initially tried on four patients, and the researchers report that the implant worked well in these volunteers for up to 300 days, which is how long the patients were observed. The patients were able to pick up small toy blocks and food cans and make a fist or pinch fingers together.",

    title: "Amputation: Prosthetic Hand And Fingers",
    description: "Amputation involves injury to your nerves. When nerves are cut by trauma or surgery, there may be some long-term symptoms. These symptoms include pain, cold sensitivity, abnormal sensations, or phantom sensation. Phantom sensation occurs when you feel that the absent part is still present. Keep your surgeon up to date. Early treatment of symptoms may work better. If your symptoms are disabling and persistent, they can often be treated with another surgery. For example, you may feel severe pain in a small area. This is caused by a neuroma, an enlarged end of the nerve. This may cause severe pain with light pressure.",

    title: "What are the advantages of a finger/partial hand prosthesis?",
    description: "The secure hold and good wearer comfort are achieved by the socket of the prosthesis. The socket connects the residual limb and the prosthesis. It is custom fabricated for your residual limb. A firm, direct connection between the prosthesis and your residual limb is created by vacuum. The finger prosthesis adheres firmly to the residual limb in every position and for every grasp movement. Your advantage - you can make precise movements again. In addition, a perfect fit reduces perspiration.Simultaneously, a greater degree of wearer comfort is achieved by the use of different levels of material stiffness in a custom-fabricated socket.",

    title: "Using a Prosthetic Device",
    description: "When an arm or other extremity is amputated or lost, a prosthetic device, or prosthesis, can play an important role in rehabilitation. For many people, an artificial limb can improve mobility and the ability to manage daily activities, as well as provide the means to stay independent.There is a wide variety of prostheses that are designed to function -- and in many cases look -- like a natural arm, leg, hand, or foot.",

    title: "Silicone Prosthesis",
    description: "All silicone gel implants are cross-linked to maintain a gel consistency, and thus all silicone gel has cohesive properties. As the cross-linking is increased, the consistency or firmness of the ‘liquid-feeling’ gel changes to that of a soft cheese. The enhanced cohesive nature of these implants makes them ‘form stable’. This refers to the implant’s maintaining its shape in all positions (shape maintenance). These implants are designed in various anatomic dimensions in addition to round shapes and are collectively referred to as cohesive silicone gel implants. These form-stable implants are currently popular worldwide38 and undergoing FDA-approved clinical trials in the United States.",

    title: "History of Python and Comparison with Other Languages",
    description: "Python is a relatively simple programming language that includes a rich set of supporting libraries. This approach keeps the language simple and reliable, while providing specialized feature sets as separate extensions.Python has an easy-to-use syntax, focused on the programmer who must type in the program, read what was typed, and provide formal documentation for the program. Many languages have syntax focused on developing a simple, fast compiler; but those languages may sacrifice readability and writability. Python strikes a good balance between fast compilation, readability and writability.Python is implemented in C, and relies on the extensive, well understood, portable C libraries. It fits seamlessly with Unix, Linux and POSIX environments.",

    title: "Why Use Python for AI and Machine Learning?",
    description: "AI projects differ from traditional software projects. The differences lie in the technology stack, the skills required for an AI-based project, and the necessity of deep research. To implement your AI aspirations, you should use a programming language that is stable, flexible, and has tools available. Python offers all of this, which is why we see lots of Python AI projects today.From development to deployment and maintenance, Python helps developers be productive and confident about the software they’re building. Benefits that make Python the best fit for machine learning and AI-based projects include simplicity and consistency, access to great libraries and frameworks for AI and machine learning (ML), flexibility, platform independence, and a wide community. These add to the overall popularity of the language.",
